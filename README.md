# This folder contains two files.

# The first is an R Markdown file containing the code used to fit each of our models to discrimination task data.
# All packages required to run the code are noted in the first chunk of the R Markdown file.
# The second file is a sample of the data collected in our experiment.
# You should be able to download these two files and run the models over the sample data.
